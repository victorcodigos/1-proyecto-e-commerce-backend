# <h1 align="center"> ⚙️ Description | Development 🔧 </h1>

For this project I have made a diagram creating different tables and the relationship between them (1:N, N:M, N:M).

#  🧑‍💻 Also, I have created a REST API capable of the following points:

- User login + logout. Token (JWT) + middleware.
- Creation of a CRUD.
- User registration using Bcrypt.
- At least one Many to Many relationship and another One to Many.
- Use of seeders.

# Diagram


##### User:Orders have a (1:N) relationship since a user can have several orders but an order can only belong to one user.

##### Orders:Products had a relationship of (N:M) so an intermediate table was created, and automatically the two Foreing Key remain in the mentioned tables

##### Products:Categories had a relationship of (N:M) so an intermediate table was created, and automatically the two Foreing Key remain in the mentioned tables.

- Below I have an example
