# <h1 align="center"> ⚙️ Description | Development 🔧 </h1>

For this project I have made a diagram creating different tables and the relationship between them (1:N, N:M, N:M).

#  🧑‍💻 Also, I have created a REST API capable of the following points:

- User login + logout. Token (JWT) + middleware.
- Creation of a CRUD.
- User registration using Bcrypt.
- At least one Many to Many relationship and another One to Many.
- Use of seeders.

# Diagram


##### User:Orders have a (1:N) relationship since a user can have several orders but an order can only belong to one user.

##### Orders:Products had a relationship of (N:M) so an intermediate table was created, and automatically the two Foreing Key remain in the mentioned tables

##### Products:Categories had a relationship of (N:M) so an intermediate table was created, and automatically the two Foreing Key remain in the mentioned tables.

- Below I have an example

# <h1 align="center"> 🎯 Using the Postman to testing the REST API 🖥️  </h1> 

 #### CRUD is the acronym for CREATE, READ, UPDATE and DELETE. These terms describe the four essential operations for creating and managing persistent data elements, mainly in relational and NoSQL databases.
 #### This project helps me a lot. From now I do understand the CRUD concept and I can create, view, modify and remove the data from the database, I can virtually create any application I can imagine.

### <h1 align="center"> 🥷 Using the Bcrypt for all passwords 🥷 </h1> 

##### Bcrypt is an algorithm designed to hash and salt passwords for safe storage. It's an industry standard that's time-tested and proven to resist threats from hackers and other malicious agents.

### <h1 align="center"> ⚒️  Middleware 🗝️ </h1>

##### Middleware is software that lies between an operating system and the applications running on it. Essentially functioning as hidden translation layer, middleware enables communication and data management for distributed applications.

### <h1 align="center"> 🚀 JWT:  Json web token   🖊️ </h1>

#####  JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519">(RFC 7519)</a> that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. JWTs can be signed using a secret.
